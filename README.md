# OS Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A comprehensive, interactive web application that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. This project provides a visual representation of how different scheduling algorithms work, complete with Gantt charts and performance metrics.

## üåü Features

### Supported Scheduling Algorithms

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
   - Non-preemptive scheduling
   - Processes executed in arrival order
   - Simple implementation but may cause convoy effect

2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
   - Non-preemptive scheduling
   - Processes with shortest burst time executed first
   - Optimal for minimizing average waiting time

3. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
   - Preemptive version of SJF
   - Process with shortest remaining time gets CPU
   - Most optimal for minimizing waiting time

4. **Round Robin (RR)**
   - Preemptive scheduling with time quantum
   - Each process gets fixed time slice
   - Prevents starvation and provides fair scheduling

5. **Priority Scheduling**
   - Non-preemptive scheduling based on priority
   - Higher priority processes executed first
   - May cause starvation of low-priority processes

6. **Multilevel Queue**
   - Multiple priority queues
   - Higher priority queues served first
   - Aging mechanism to prevent starvation

### Key Features

- **Interactive Process Management**: Add, remove, and configure processes with arrival time, burst time, and priority
- **Real-time Gantt Charts**: Visual representation of process execution timeline
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive analysis including:
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - Average Waiting Time
  - Average Response Time
  - CPU Utilization
  - Throughput
  - Total Execution Time
- **Sample Data**: Pre-configured examples for quick testing
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, intuitive interface with smooth animations

## üìä Algorithm Details

### First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **Type**: Non-preemptive
- **Advantages**: Simple, fair
- **Disadvantages**: Convoy effect, poor response time
- **Best For**: Batch processing systems

### Shortest Job First (SJF)
- **Type**: Non-preemptive
- **Advantages**: Minimum average waiting time
- **Disadvantages**: Requires knowing burst times
- **Best For**: Batch systems with known job lengths

### Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- **Type**: Preemptive
- **Advantages**: Optimal for minimizing waiting time
- **Disadvantages**: Context switching overhead
- **Best For**: Interactive systems

### Round Robin (RR)
- **Type**: Preemptive
- **Advantages**: Fair, prevents starvation
- **Disadvantages**: Overhead from context switching
- **Best For**: Time-sharing systems

### Priority Scheduling
- **Type**: Non-preemptive
- **Advantages**: Handles priority-based requirements
- **Disadvantages**: Starvation of low-priority processes
- **Best For**: Real-time systems

### Multilevel Queue
- **Type**: Hybrid
- **Advantages**: Handles different process types
- **Disadvantages**: Complex implementation
- **Best For**: Mixed workload systems

## üé® Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Object-oriented programming with classes and modules
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for enhanced UI
- **Google Fonts**: Typography (Inter font family)

### Key Components

#### SchedulingSimulator Class
- Main application logic
- Algorithm implementations
- Process management
- Results calculation

#### UI Components
- Process input forms

## üìà Performance Metrics Explained

### Turnaround Time
- Total time from process arrival to completion
- Formula: `Completion Time - Arrival Time`

### Waiting Time
- Total time process spends waiting in ready queue
- Formula: `Turnaround Time - Burst Time`

### Response Time
- Time from arrival to first CPU allocation
- Formula: `Start Time - Arrival Time`

### CPU Utilization
- Percentage of time CPU is busy
- Formula: `(Total Burst Time / Total Time) √ó 100`

### Throughput
- Number of processes completed per unit time
- Formula: `Number of Processes / Total Time`

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Algorithms
1. Implement the algorithm method in the `SchedulingSimulator` class
2. Add algorithm info to the `algorithmInfo` object
3. Update the `calculateSchedule` method switch statement
4. Add option to the HTML select element
